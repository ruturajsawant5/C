    int n, m;

    *p = 100; 
    m = *p; 

    Let M[1000:1003] -> n 
        M[1004:1007] -> m 

        M[2000:2007] -> p

        *p = 100; 

        RHS -> No evalulation needed. 100 

        it is assigned to *p 

        Applying de-reference operator on pointer 
        == 
        Bringing out address stored inside it. 
        M[2000:2007] -> address -> BRING OUT 

        M[1000] --> Step 1: Bringing out address stored inside poitner 

        Step 2: Decide the operation to be performed on it. 
                Possible operations
                (i) read (ii) write (iii) execute / call / transfer the control 

                How to decide? 

                *p is on RHS then read from pointee. 
                *p is on LHS then write on pointee. 

                In our case *p = 100; 
                *p is on LHS and therefore, we are going to WRITE (MODIFY)
                M[1000]

        Step 3: How many bytes from address should be used to perform 
                read / write operation? 

                Refer to the type of pointee. 
                int* p;

                M[1000:1000+sizeof(pointee)-1]

                M[ADDR IN PTR : ADDR IN PTR + SIZEOF(POINTEE)-1]

                M[1000:1003] <- 100 

        m = *p; 

        1) RHS 
            *p 

            Bring out address in p 
            Bring out address in M[2000:2007]
            Comes out to be 1000. 

        2) Decide operation (R/W)
            Ans: Read 
            Why? because *p is in ON RHS 

        3) How many bytes from M[1000] should be used to read 

            M[ADDR IN PTR : ADDR IN PTR + sizeof(POINTEE) - 1]
            M[1000:1000+sizeof(int)-1]
            M[1000:1000+4-1]
            M[1000:1003]

            Therefore, read M[1000:1003]

        2) LHS 
            m -> M[1004:1007]

            M[1004:1007] <- M[1000:1003]
            [
                R <- M[1000:1003]
                M[1004:1007] <- R

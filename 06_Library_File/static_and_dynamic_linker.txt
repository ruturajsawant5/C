We have learnt that libraries come in two flavours 

1) static link library 
2) dynamic link library 

libraries are attached (or linked) with the object 
file of our source code so that built in algorithms 
used in the source code will work! 

the software which carries out this linking process 
is called as linker. 

Like libraries, linker also come in two flavours 

i) static linker for linking static link libraries 
ii) dynamic linker for linking dynamic link libraries 

On Linux OS: /usr/bin/ld itself is a static linker 
/lib/ld-linux.so.2 is a dynamic linker

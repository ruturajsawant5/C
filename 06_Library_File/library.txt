The libray file is a binary file. 
It contains definition of all functions in machine language form! 

We ask library developer to create a text file containing 
declarations of all 1000 functions that are callable and 
implemented in library. 

That text file is known as a header file. 

Amongst other things, header file cotaints 
    1)  data declaration statements 
    2)  Type (struct) definition statements 
    3)  typedefs 
    4)  definition of inline functions 
    5)  Preprocessor directives (conditional inclusion)
    6)  Symbolic constants 
    7)  Macros

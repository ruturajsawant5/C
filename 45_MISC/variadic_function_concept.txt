Variadic function: 

A function which is capable of accepting different number of 
actual parameter per call is known as the variadic function. 

e.g. printf(); 

printf() has one mandatory first parameter called as format string. 
But actual parameters after format string can be any in number 
and can be of any type. You can take decision about those on per call 
basis. 

printf("Hello,World\n");

printf("%d, %f\n", n, f); 

printf("%f %d\n", f, n); 

printf("n = %d, fnum = %f, long_fnum = %lf, s_num = %hd\n", 
        m, fnum, long_fnum, s_num); 

This proves that the printf() is a variadic function. 
You can also see that the scanf() is also a variadic function.

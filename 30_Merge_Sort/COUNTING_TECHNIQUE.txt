Let a and b be two natural numbers such that a < b. 
To count number of integers between a and b we must 
consider following four scenarios. 

all k such that a <= k <= b deonted as [a, b]
all k such that a < k <= b denoted as (a, b] 
all k such that a <= k < b denoted as [a, b)
all k such that a < k < b denoted as (a, b)

Numbers between [a, b] : b - a + 1
Numbers between (a, b] : b - a
Numbers between [a, b) : b - a 
Numbers between (a, b) : b - a - 1

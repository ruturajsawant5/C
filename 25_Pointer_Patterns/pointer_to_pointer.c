    ----------------------------------------------
    n is of the type int. 
    
    To create a block of memory capable of holding 
    address of n is 
    int* p;

    Now it is possible to generalise above process 
    further (upto any level)

    Can you create a block of memory ( = 8 bytes )
    capable of holding the address of pointer to int 

    int** pp; 
    pp is a pointer to pointer to int

    p = &n; 
    pp = &p; 

    Type system wise analysis 

    type(n) == int 
    type(&n) == int* 

    RHS == &n 
    LHS == must be of type int* 

    int* p = &n; 

    int* p; 

    type(p) == int* 
    type(&p) == int** 

    Therefore, if you want &p on RHS 
    then LHS must be of type int** 

    int** pp = &p; 

    --------------------------------------

    assuming p contains address of n. 
    to access (=read/write) n through p, 

    *p is used. 

    int* p; 

    type(*p) == int 
    and therefore, *p on RHS reads from n 
    *p on LHS writes on in 

    Assuming p contains address of n 
    and pp contains address of p. 

    int** pp; 
    type(**pp) == int 

    Using **pp on RHS will read from n 
    Using **pp on LHS will write on n 

    int **pp; 

    type(pp) == int** 
    type(**pp) == int 

    type(*pp) == int* 

    threfore, 

    Using *pp on RHS will read from p 
    (address in p can fetched by using *pp on RHS)

    *pp on LHS will write on p
    (address in p can be used using *pp on LHS 
    i.e you can make p point to some other integer 
    by puting *pp on LHS)

    (to which integer p is currently pointing to 
    can be known by using *pp on RHS)

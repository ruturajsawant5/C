1) Program 1 -> p01.c

    The main() function does dynamic memory allocation for array. 
    But it does not set the values for array element. 

    instead it sends the base address of array and the array size 
    to a function named fill array which populates the array elements 
    with valid values. 

    On returning from fill_array(), the main function again calls 
    function show_array() to which it sends the base address of array 
    and its size. The show array function displays the values of array 
    elements which are consistent with the values set in fill array. 

    On returning from fill array, the main() function frees the memory 
    allocated to array using free() function. 

    Role of main(): 
        allocate memory to array 
        free memory allocated to array 

    Role of fill_array(): 
        Accept base address and size of array from main() 
        and populate array elements with values based on their indices. 

    Role of show_array(): 
        Accept base address and size of array form main() and 
        display the contents of array elements.  

2) Program 2 -> p02.c 

    The main() function declares a pointer p and integer N to store 
    the base address and size of array respectively. The main() function 
    initialises pointer 0 and N to -1 (i.e. invalid values of pointer and size)

    The main() function calls the get_array() function

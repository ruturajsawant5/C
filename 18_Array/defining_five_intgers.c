/* 
    It is possible to create multiple instances of same data type 
    by writing multiple data definition statements. 

    But this approach will work only for small number of integers 
    say five or ten at the most. 

    This approach will not scale for large number of integers. 
    For example, it will be unwise to write 500 different 
    data definition statements, defining 500 different variable 
    names to allocate 500 different integrs. 

    To address this issue, the C programming language allows us 
    to create arrays of data types. 

    array = things arranged in tandem. 
            things arranged in a contiguous manner. 

    The phrase array of integers would mean 
    multiple integers arranged in program memory contiguously. 

    The phrase array of characters would mean 
    a contiguous sequence of bytes storing the ASCII values of 
    characters. 

    The phrase array of doubles would mean 
    multiple instances of double precision variables arranged in 
    tandem.

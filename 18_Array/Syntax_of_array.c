/* 
    To define an array of instances of data types, 
    we must follow 4 steps. 

    Step I: We must decide the name of variable. 
            Our choice = i_arr 

    Step II: You must write a pair of square brackets 
            i.e. [] = subscript operator after variable name 
            so that the C compiler will understand that 
            i_arr is a name of array. 

            i_arr[] 

    Step III: You must specify the number of multiple instances 
                to be stored in array. This number must be mentioned 
                between the square brackets 
                Our choice = 5

            i_arr[5]

    Step IV: You must write the type of all elements in array on the 
            left hand side of array variable name. 

            int i_arr[5]; 

    The above statement defines the array of five integers in program 
    memory and the first integer of which is named as i_arr.
